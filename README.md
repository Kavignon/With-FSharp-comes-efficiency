This repository is the companion to the book
["With F# comes efficiency"](https://leanpub.com/withfcomesefficiency).
It contains the source code discussed in the book. If you have questions,
comments, or want to report errors, I also set up a [Google Group forum]
(https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/machine-learning-projects-for-dotnet-developers).
Hope you enjoy the book, and... feel free to ping me as

hate the book, let the world know what you think (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or whatever floats your boat :) )
